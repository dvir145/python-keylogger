# python-keylogger

A python keylogger that uses sockets to communicate with the server securely by using asymetric encryption.
There are options to configure the keylogger data:
  1. Screenshot on certain events
  2. Monitor clipboard
  3. Dynamic keylogging - Remove text when logging backspace
The server script has a GUI to easily control and see the data.

The client script replicates and hides itself in certain directories and edits the windows registry so it runs on startup.
The keylogger can recognize the current keyboard language and notifies when it's changed.
